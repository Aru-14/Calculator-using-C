# Infix-Expression-Calculator-using-C
I have created an Infix Expression Calculator that evaluates the value of an Infix expression like
8*7 -(6/3) + 6 using C language.
• It uses the concept of Stack Data Structure. 
• I have used three stacks of character datatype. 1st stack contains the input infix expression, 2nd
contains the postfix expression (obtained by infix to postfix conversion algorithm) of input and 
3
rd contains the result obtained by evaluation of postfix expression.
• It accepts single digit input only, not two or three digit input.
